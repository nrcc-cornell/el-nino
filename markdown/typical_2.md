Although each El Niño is different, there are some general patterns that are predictable. For instance, the polar jet stream is typically farther north than usual. The dry winter conditions that characterize Ohio and the Midwest commonly extend eastward into western New York and Pennsylvania. 

The Pacific jet stream remains across the southern U.S. As storms often move up the coast during El Niño winters, the Eastern Seaboard generally experiences above-normal precipitation.

Since much of the region lies between the two storm tracks, temperature and precipitation patterns vary considerably from south to north.
