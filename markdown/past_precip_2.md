Analysis from the [Baltimore/Washington National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/lwx/research_dcbalt_elnino) indicates that winter precipitation tends to be near normal during El Niño years (1950-2016) for Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Broken down by strength, these sites generally experienced drier than normal conditions during weak El Niño events but generally saw wetter than normal conditions during strong El Niño events. National Weather Service notes, “These findings can partly be linked to a stronger than normal sub-tropical jet that typically occurs during moderate to strong El Niño winters, which would favor more active storm systems from the south that draw warm, moist air northward as opposed to the drier Alberta clippers from the northwest.”
