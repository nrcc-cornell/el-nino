Analysis from the [Baltimore/Washington National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/lwx/research_dcbalt_elnino) indicates that winter snowfall tends to be above normal during El Niño years (1950-2016) for Baltimore and Washington, D.C. regardless of strength, but was particularly notable during moderate events. Despite this, there is variability with these events. For instance, National Weather Service notes, “Of the seven strong El Niño winters since 1950 (through 2016), four have been associated with well above normal snowfall while snowfall was virtually absent in the other three winters.”
