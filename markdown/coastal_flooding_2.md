[NOAA’s High Tide Flooding Outlook](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/high-tide-flooding/annual-outlook.html) states, “This year, the Mid-Atlantic is an area predicted to experience the most high tide flooding due to the effects of El Niño conditions, which flattens the atmospheric jet stream over the southern United States in the winter and spring, increasing the frequency of storms in the south, many of which move up the coast producing storm surge. Though the frequency of high tide flooding highly varies year to year, the Mid-Atlantic is predicted to experience a 300% increase in flood days since the year 2000. This year, the Mid-Atlantic is predicted to experience between 9 and 14 high tide flood days.”
