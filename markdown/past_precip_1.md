#### Precipitation

The maps to the right illustrate the percent of normal precipitation for winter during all El Niño years since 1950.

During most El Niño winters, portions of western Pennsylvania and/or West Virginia saw below-normal precipitation. Western New York also tended to be drier than normal but leaned wetter during six out of the eight most recent El Niño events. Meanwhile, coastal areas tended to be wetter than normal in about half of all El Niño winters. The classic El Niño pattern of a drier-than-normal Ohio Valley and wetter-than-normal coastal areas is prominent during the strong El Niño winters of 1957-58 and 1972-73.
