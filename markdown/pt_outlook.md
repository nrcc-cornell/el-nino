### Winter Temperature and Precipitation Outlooks

As of mid-November, [NOAA's winter outlooks](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) (right) show that above-normal temperatures are favored for the entire Northeast, with the greatest likelihood in northern New York, northern New England, and northeastern Massachusetts.

The precipitation outlook indicates that eastern West Virginia and areas closer to the coast from Maryland to southern New Hampshire could see above-normal precipitation due to a favored storm track across the southern U.S. and up the East Coast. This track generally means limited storms across the northern tier of the U.S. including the Ohio Valley. As such, a drier-than-normal winter is slightly favored for northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York. Additionally, lake-effect snowfall tends to be reduced in these areas during El Ni√±o events. Equal chances of below-, near-, or above-normal temperatures are forecast for the rest of the region.
