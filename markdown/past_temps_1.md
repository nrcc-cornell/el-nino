### Winter Conditions During Past El Niños

#### Temperature

The maps to the right illustrate the average temperature departures for winter during all El Niño years since 1950.

Cooler-than-normal temperatures seem to be more prominent during El Niño winters between 1950 and 1980, shown by the blue colors on the maps in the top two rows and the left side of the middle row. However, for El Niño winters since 1982 (which includes the middle map, those to its right, and the bottom two rows), orange and red colors appear more frequently, indicating warmer-than-normal temperatures. 

During strong El Niño winters, temperatures were generally warmer than normal, particularly in 1997-98 and 2015-16. Meanwhile, temperatures tended to lean cooler than normal during weak El Niño winters including 1976-77 and 2014-15.
